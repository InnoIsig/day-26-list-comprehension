#Exercice 1
"""
You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called squared_numbers. 
This new list should contain every number in the list numbers but each number should be 
squared. 
e.g.
4 * 4 = 16
4 squared equals 16.
**DO NOT** modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
Target Output 
[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]

#Exercice 2
"""
In this list comprehension exercise you will practice using list comprehension to filter 
out the even numbers from a series of numbers.   
First, use list comprehension to convert the list_of_strings to a list of integers 
called numbers.   
Then use list comprehension again to create a new list called result.
This new list should only contain the even numbers from the list numbers. 
Again, try to use Python's List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are 
common in both files. 
e.g. if file1.txt contained:

2
